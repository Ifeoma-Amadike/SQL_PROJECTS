## INTRODUCTION 
---
Instacart, an American company, provides grocery delivery and pick-up services in the United States and Canada. Customers can access these services through a website and a mobile app, enabling them to order groceries from participating retailers. Personal shoppers then handle the shopping on behalf of the customers. This project specifically focuses on the denormalization of the Instacart orders dataset, along with some basic data analysis.

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

I used advanced SQL functions to import and normalize the dataset. Subsequently, I performed basic data analysis by querying the database, all within the PostgreSQL environment.

I created four(4) Tables which are
